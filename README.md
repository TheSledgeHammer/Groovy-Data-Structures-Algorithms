# Groovy-Data-Structures-Algorithms
The following Contains various helpful data structure classes. Based from my Java Data Structures & Algorithms Project.
Currently doesn't contain all the data structure.

### Includes:

#### Lists:
* SinglyLinkedList
* DoublyLinkedList
* CircularDoublyLinkedList

#### Maps:
* CircularDoublyLinkedMap: A Map implementation of a CircularDoublyLinkedList. Near exactly same as CircularDoublyLinkedList but with a key-value pair.

#### Tables: Structure is based of Google Gauva's Tables
* CircularDoublyLinkedTable: A Table implementation of a CircularDoublyLinkedList. Similar to CircularDoublyLinkedList but with a row-column-value triplet.

#### Hashing (Work In Progress):
* Contains a New API for creating data structures using hash algorithms.
